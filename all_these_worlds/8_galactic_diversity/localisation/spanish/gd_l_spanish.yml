 ##Resources

 seeds_desc:0 "A seed is an embryonic plant, that is naturally dispersed as means of reproduction. They can be collected by farming on planets with an active biosphere, and planted in planets lacking one, or to increarse diversity if the planet has the required atmospheric and hydrospheric conditions for plant life to flourish, from simple lichen to more complex mixed trees."
 greenhouse_gases:0 "Greenhouse Gases"
 greenhouse_gases_desc:0 "Gases that absorb and emit radiant energy within the thermal infrared range, causing a greenhouse effect. These can be siphoned from the atmospheres of certain gas giants or toxic worlds. They are primarily used on terraforming projects, to thicken a planet's atmosphere while also increasing the surface temperature by trapping more heat beneath the atmosphere."

 water_ices_desc:0 "Ices made of frozen water, these can be mined from frozen planets or ice asteroids, as well as siphoned from the atmospheres of certain ice giants. They are primarily used on terraforming projects, to improve a planet's atmosphere by seeding water-vapour, which may also result in more liquid water on the surface."
