 # Exotic
 class_molten_desc:0 "The Molten-class world has a thin or non-existent toxic atmosphere. Lava from its interior flows freely in the surface due to constant volcanic eruptions while the scorching hot conditions prevent it from solidifying, resulting in a partially-molten surface, or in more extreme cases a lava ocean."
 class_ice_desc:0 "The Ice-class Panthalassic world typically lurks beyond a star system's habitable zone. It has low density as it is mostly composed of frozen volatiles such as water, ammonia or methane."
 class_chthonian_desc:0 "The Chthonian-class world is the metallic core of a gas giant that has spiraled inward from the outer zone of the star system, and been stripped of its gaseous components."
 class_helium_giant_desc:0 "The Helium-class Hot Giant has an atmosphere dominated by helium. It usually evolved as a standard gas giant orbiting close to its star, and had its lighter gases driven off through evaporation, depleting the hydrogen in the atmospheres over time, leaving a greater proportion of helium behind."
 # Telluric
 class_dusty_desc:0 "The Dusty-class Telluric world is barren and large enough to retain an atmosphere, with a surface deeply covered by finely grained iron oxide dust."
 class_iron_desc:0 "The Iron-class Cratered world is usually formed close to a star where iron-rich material is present in the protoplanetary disk. It has a larger core of nickel and iron, and a thinner mantle of silicate rocks, making it geologically inactive."
 class_silicate_desc:0 "The Silicate-class Cratered world is a geologically dead planet with a high concentration of silicon conpounds on the surface, often riddled with meteor impact craters preserved through the ages due to the lack of any forms of erosion."
 class_volcanic_desc:0 "The Volcanic-class Telluric world is geologically-active, with a surface filled with lava lakes and floodplains of liquid rock."
 class_frozen_desc:0 "The Frozen-class Telluric world has a surface composed of rocky materials and volatile ices, it may also have a sub-surface liquid ocean if warmed by internal heat or tidal forces."
 # Toxic
 class_hothouse_desc:0 "The Hothouse-class Toxic world is a hot planet with a surface covered by volcanic plains and a high-pressure atmosphere composed primarily by greenhouse gases."
 class_methane_desc:0 "The Methane-class Toxic world is a cold planet with a barren surface riddled with lakes and seas made of hydrocarbons."
 class_carbonyl_desc:0 "The Carbonyl-class Toxic world is a carbon-rich planet with diamond-spewing volcanoes and seas made of tar."
 # Panthalassic
 class_water_panthalassic_desc:0 "The Water-class Panthalassic world has an ocean composed of water, with the proper temperature and pressure conditions to allow it to remain in liquid state."
 class_ammonia_panthalassic_desc:0 "The Ammonia-class Panthalassic world has an ocean composed of ammonia in an eutectic mixture with water, with the proper temperature and pressure conditions to allow it to remain in liquid state."
 class_methane_panthalassic_desc:0 "The Methane-class Panthalassic world has an ocean composed of hydrocarbons, with the proper temperature and pressure conditions to allow it to remain in liquid state."
 # Gas Giant
 class_super_giant_desc:0 "The Super-class Gas Giant is a gaseous world which is far more massive than a regular gas giant, although not necessarily larger, as the increased gravity compresses the planet's many layers."
 class_ammonia-clouded_giant_desc:0 "The Ammonia-clouded-class Gas Giant is likely the most common type of Gas Giant, with an atmosphere composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, and significant layers of visible ammonia clouds."
 class_water-clouded_giant_desc:0 "The Water-clouded-class Gas Giant has an atmosphere composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, too warm to form ammonia clouds, instead it has a significant water-cycle in its outer layers as water-vapour rises from its warmer interior, condenses in huge clouds, and falls as rain in a never-ending cycle."
 class_cloudless_giant_desc:0 "The Cloudless-class Hot Giant has an atmosphere composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, lacking a global cloud cover because it lacks suitable chemicals to form clouds."
 class_alkaline_giant_desc:0 "The Alkaline-class Hot Giant is a very hot gaseous world, with carbon monoxide becoming the dominant carbon-carrying molecule in its atmosphere, rather than methane, and with high concentrations of alkali metals."
 class_silicate_giant_desc:0 "The Silicate-class Hot Giant is an extremely hot gaseous world, with high concentrations of silicate and iron in its outer cloud layers."
 # Ice Giant
 class_frigid_giant_desc:0 "The Frigid-class Ice Giant is a gaseous world with an interior that doesnt produce much heat, resulting in a mostly uniform appearance due to lack of turbulence."
 class_methane_giant_desc:0 "The Methane-class Ice Giant is a gaseous world with an inner hot layer of methane that condenses and decomposes to form diamond, which generates heat as it rains down onto the solid core."
 class_turbulent_giant_desc:0 "The Turbulent-class Ice Giant is a gaseous world with an inner layer of liquid metallic water and ammonia under extreme pressure and heat, resulting in a dense and turbulent cloud cover."
 class_temperate_giant_desc:0 "The Temperate-class Ice Giant is a gaseous world with a layer of liquid water between gaseous water-vapour clouds and a supercritical ocean."
