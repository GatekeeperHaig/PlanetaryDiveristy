#Start Text

For the Tree's sake, we spread out over [GetHomeWorldName], planting and watching offshoots of the Tree wherever we went.\n\nOur world has served the Tree for centuries, and yet we fear the Tree is not entirely safe as we have learned about the dangers of the universe. We have long known this is not the only planet; the galaxy has many Treeless worlds, and we yearn to change this.\n\nWe must protect the Tree. The Tree must spread. The Tree must grow."
