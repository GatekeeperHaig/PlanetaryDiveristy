 pc_molten:0 "Molten World"
 pc_molten_desc:0 "\nMolten worlds are typically young worlds with a crust that has yet to harden. These planets usually cool and evolve into a different class, some with the right conditions may even one day support life, while others may remain molten indefinitely due to tidal forces if they are too close to a star or in orbit of a gas giant."
