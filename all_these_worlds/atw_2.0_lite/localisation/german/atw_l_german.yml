Do you want to investigate these rumours?\n\n§GOption A:§!Ridiculous.\n\n§GOption B:§!If Venus could be developed, it could one day rival the Earth, send an exploration team to investigate, but ignore the rumours about Titan, its too cold anyway.\n\n§GOption C:§!Venus is too hot, how could we ever change such an environment? But if there's even a remote possibility of having an outpost in the outer system on Titan, we should not ignore it!\n\n§GOption D:§!Any private company able to operate outside our planet should be taken seriously!
