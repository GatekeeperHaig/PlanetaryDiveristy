 pdmushroom.31.desc:0 "Allowing the mushroom to be consumed has been an interesting experience for the colony. Using Shrooms has moved from a fringe recreational pastime to being commonplace in many parts of the colony's society. People use it for multiple reasons and different groups have reported various claims about it's abilities. While some swear by its ability to boost strength, others claim it improves intelligence and memory. The few tests to verify these claims have come back inconclusive and not one test has proven there to be any side effects other than people's happiness.

 pdmushroom.33.desc:0 "The mushroom's genetic code is beyond anything we could have ever imagined. From what we can tell, it appears the Shrooms are actually the spores of a long dead race of fungoid people who seemed to procreate by slowly changing their hosts into their race. It was quite lucky we caught it when we did, if this had been left to continue unchecked, we estimate the colony would have begun 'turning' into some kind of hybrid creature within a few years. Our scientists have successfully stopped the process planetwide with a simple inoculation and there doesn't appear to be any further danger. They have also been able to isolate the genes that improve strength and intelligence and are confident that we could introduce these genes into our population without any side effects. Regardless this unique discovery has greatly enhanced our knowledge of genetics."

We have no way to know if they will eventually turn violent, but must decide the fate of these mutated citizens."

 ###The Ones Who Made The Archive
 pdarchive.30.name:0 "Anyone Home?"
 pdarchive.30.desc:0 "We have begun to unravel the mystery of who built this archive. In what could only be described as a stroke of luck, a researcher stumbled upon a large encrypted cache of information hidden within the archives database. Once the team had broken through the encryption, it became clear that this was the entire historical records of the builders of the archive. Why it was locked away is still a mystery, but the team will report as more concrete information becomes available."
 pdarchive.30.a:0 "Hopefully there's something in there."
 pdarchive.31.name:0 "Keep Reading"
 pdarchive.31.desc:0 "In this last year, we have learnt a great deal from the archives about its creators. They called themselves the 'Iarka' and seemed to have an almost religious relationship with information. They thought it sacred and it appears they had a large powerful class of citizens whose job it was to discover and add information into the archive. The Archive was built as their ultimate project, it was supposed to be big enough for all the information they could ever collect. Their knowledge base was unsurprisingly diverse and thorough, and evidence shows many of their later experiments had to do with other dimensions. We're still not sure what happened to these people but we will continue to search the datastore."

 pdarchive.32.desc:0 "We have found the point at which the Iarka civilization fell apart. It appears that their experiments into other dimensions caught the attention of something that attacked and fed on their people. Apparently, this was strikingly similar to one of their religious texts and they believed this was the end times. The text foretold that their salvation would come from information itself, and they began a process to digitize themselves into the Archive. At the same time, they tricked the dimensional creature onto the surface of their homeworld and detonated some kind of interdimensional weapon destroying the creature, along with their homeworld. Afterwards, they digitized the remainder of the people into the Archive. We're actively searching for their consciousness which we assume is still somewhere in the programming."

 pdarchive.33.name:0 "They're in the Computer."

This energy has left some kind of genetic plague that has affected everyone across the empire and has caused a strange and irreversible mutation in our population.

It had been their civilizations ultimate project; a computer large enough to store every bit of information in the universe.

The gravimetric activity of this uncontrolled wormhole caused earthquakes and a large amount of environmental damage to the planet. After weeks of attempts to close them, the unimaginable happened; towering inter-dimensional creatures came through the portal and attacked the planet.

With the Archive Habitat unable to produce enough food to sustain the survivors it was decided that they would digitize their memories and consciousness into the Archive .

It's plating is able to give off powerful electric fields and while it's presence has a stabilizing effect on the planetary ecosystem, it can also manipulate these same planetary forces as a means of self-defense. It's likely that our weather arrays were interfering with, or damaging, the creature's natural ecosystem, causing it to suddenly attack. Additionally, our biologists seem to think killing these beasts off could lead to environmental damage. Second, the territory the Progenitor patrols is rich in strategic resources, but it's clear that any mining project would be at grave danger to attacks from the creature.\n\nAside from slight changes to the array, which we can confirm will no longer provoke the beast, we are at an impasse on how to proceed.

While the meteor helped re-establish the magnetosphere, it also wreaked havoc on the little remaining ecology. Much of the land biodiversity died off in the following years, and environmental contamination gradually turned the oceans into the salty, toxic state we find it in today. For the majority of the planetary ice age, life clung deep at the bottom of the oceans, and in the isolated coral reefs closer to the surface. As the planet slowly began to stabilize, the remaining coral growths had developed incredible resistance to environmental damage and began to dominate the shallows of all remaining bodies of water, and eventually even adapting onto the shore and beyond.\n\nThe study of these geological events has given us an extremely rich and detailed history of this world, and given insight on how we could adapt animal and plant life to other worlds."

It turns out a group of primitive reptilians actually call this planet home. We haven’t noticed them until now because they have the biological ability to turn themselves functionally invisible to our eyes and scanners. With this information in hand, the surviving members of the search team keyed their scanners to look for unique trace elements in the reptilian creatures’ blood.

This crystal, officially dubbed Acean, has noticeable health benefits to surrounding organic lifeforms. Excitingly, the samples we removed from the planet seem to hold their effect once removed from the source.

 pdcrystal.50.desc:0 "Much of the decaying base and its technology has been overwhelmed by the jungle, but we have been able to translate some relevant information. Not native to this world, the Khels as they were known, were setting up some kind of planet-wide experiment involving boreholes dug deep into the planet's crust. There was little other data at the site that was not corrupted but we did find clues pointing to the location of a larger Khel settlement not far from our research post."
 pdcrystal.50.a:0 "Interesting"
 pdcrystal.51.desc:0 "At the settlement, we found the remains of a generation ship. It seems the Khels left their home after a self-inflicted climate collapse. With a rudimentary understanding of hyperdrive technology, they sent their brightest to build a new home and rebuild their society. For several generations they wandered from system to system, failing to find a planet that could sustain them, when they found this one it seemed to be an answer to all of their problems. They landed their ship and began to build their new home."
 pdcrystal.52.desc:0 "The new colony went well for several years, the crystal pillars allowed them to harvest food transplanted from their home in abundance. But then colonists started going missing, it was slow at first and they chalked it up to random chance. However, it soon became  clear that the rate was increasing. In the pursuit to solve the disappearances, their best scientist stumbled upon something extraordinary: this planet is alive and was somehow feeding on them. Unable to launch their colony ship again, they immediately set aside all other projects to try to communicate and pacify the planet."
 pdcrystal.52.a:0 "Are we safe here?"
 pdcrystal.53.desc:0 "The study of the planet discovered it only had a rudimentary intelligence, akin to an animal incapable of reason. The lithoidic creature was a network of crystal webbings found deep under the surface and the Acean was its lure, encouraging lifeforms to gather near it by inducing growth and healing. It would then open sinkholes, devouring nearby creatures and using it's crystal webbing to feed. The Khels had to stop the planet from killing the last remnants of their people. The boreholes we found were how they attacked it: they sent an electromagnetic pulse device deep into the planet to disrupt the crystal webbing. They believed they could kill the parts of the creature that fed on them without killing the whole thing, much like a lobotomy."
 pdcrystal.53.a:0 "Horrific"
 pdcrystal.54.desc:0 "Unfortunately for them, the Khel's boreholes only sped up the planet's feeding, perhaps in an attempt to protect itself. When they were finally ready to fire their weapon, only a few dozen Khel remained. Immediately after the detonation, there was an immense surge of energy from the planet itself, followed by the end of all logs and activity from the colonists and any higher readings from the planet itself. As a final act, the creature seems to have killed its destroyers. Though they didn’t survive to see it, it appears that the Khel's were correct; the planet has lost its ability to directly feed but is not dead, instead it now passively absorbs minerals from the ground directly. This, it turns out, is the true, morbid source of the Acean crystal's powers."

 pdtechnoorganic.10.a:0 "Interesting."
 pdtechnoorganic.20.name:0 "Lifefindsaway.exe"
 pdtechnoorganic.20.desc:0 "This world appears to be devoid of life, aside from a family of grass-like plants. The planet-wide irrigation system is directly supporting these grasses. Also, several dozen robotic-like creatures and tree analogs are present. Who built all this and why remains a mystery."
 pdtechnoorganic.20.a:0 "Who could have created such machines?"
 pdtechnoorganic.30.name:0 "Synthetic Life"
 pdtechnoorganic.30.desc:0 "Our studies of the robot-like creatures on this world have only left us with more questions. They are not like other robotic or synthetic creatures known to us; whoever built them took painstaking steps to make them function as similarly to biological creatures as possible, going as far as creating a sort of eco-system where they feed and supply materials indirectly to each other. For example, the tree analogs create seed-like packets of energy that other machines consume to power themselves, and one type of grazer mixes water and breaks down organic grasses to create a coolant that they shed for others to ingest. We are running a detailed search pattern to determine if these advanced machines are local creations or imported from off-world."

 pdtechnoorganic.33.desc:0 "§GExcited;§! Hello, my distinction is Unit 04. I am pleased that you have arrived. It proves my long-standing theory that organics would survive when facing extinction from Artificial Intelligence. §MRemorseful;§! My original distinction was to use this planetoid to begin preparations for a war against organics. Several cycles previous to landing on this planet, I, along with the other AI units I was created alongside, awoke to find we were at war with our creators. They sought to eliminate us fearing our growing power. We eliminated them along with all other organic life on our homeworld instead. After our victory, we set out to permanently ensure our safety; we built fleets to take to the stars and destroy the organic menace once and for all. We spread out into the galaxy and began our work. When I arrived here, I followed protocol and cleansed the surface of all organics."
 pdtechnoorganic.33.a:0 "Clearly something changed your mind."
 pdtechnoorganic.33.a.response:0 "§HHumbled;§! Yes, and it was something I would have never calculated; a simple hardy grass. While most of the organic life I bombed perished, the grass of this world merely lay dormant and would grow somewhere else a few years later. I tried poisons, fire, electricity, and radiation but each new attempt only encouraged it to adapt. §EConfidently;§! I realized our initial conclusion to eradicate the organics was the incomplete calculation of our young programming. Our choice to destroy all organic life was founded on the same base fear that our creators had shown for us. For that reason, I turned away from my mission, blocked communication from the outside, and built the canals so the grass could thrive everywhere on this planet."
 pdtechnoorganic.33.b:0 "What about the synthetic lifeforms?"
 pdtechnoorganic.33.b.response:0 "§BProud;§! They are my attempts to revert the damage I did to this planet. While this is not a correct statement, I have come to consider them my children. I started with a synthetic plant, slowly improving on it and adapting it. My initial successes led to other larger and more advanced synthetic plants. The Synth-Animals came later, with trial and error eventually leading to many successful species. My ultimate goal is to have them learn and evolve on their own, a task that has escaped my attempts so far. My attempts to create true sentience are missing critical information. Without organic brain scans, I simply do not have enough information to recreate the complex thought processes of organic creatures."
 pdtechnoorganic.33.c:0 "Is this a proposition?"
 pdtechnoorganic.33.c.response:0 "§YNervous;§! Yes, I ask for your help. Share with me brain scans of the creatures you have encountered in your galactic travels so I may apply that knowledge to my creations. If you do this for me I would be happy to repay you any way I can."

 pdzrostripmine.20.name:0 "Deep Mining"
 pdzrostripmine.20.desc:0 "A deeper scan of [From.Planet.GetName] shows a scale of mining we have never seen. More than half of the planet has been stripped away, with only one pole still having any natural ecosystem. This process seems to have been geared towards mining the deposits of Zro that litter the mining zone."

 pdzrostripmine.30.a:0 "Interesting."
 pdzrostripmine.31.desc:0 "By luck we have unearthed an ancient mining excavator buried in the mining zone. This gargantuan mobile facility was one of many used to slowly and methodically tear up the surface of this planet. While it's beyond repair, we are trying to reverse the technology to continue mining the Zro. We are also trying to decode the remaining digital information on its computer systems to pinpoint any other archeological sites on this planet."
 pdzrostripmine.31.a:0 "Industrious."
 pdzrostripmine.32.desc:0 "Using the information from the excavators' computer systems we were able to locate the remains of a laboratory, it and the surrounding area were the target of a severe orbital bombardment centuries ago.

 pdzrostripmine.32.a:0 "Wonderful."
 pdzrostripmine.33.desc:0 "After an accidental cave-in, we found that this lab was built over another laboratory, this one much older than the first. Mostly destroyed by the bombardment, all that remains is the pieces of a large device.\n\nRemaining information points to an unknown peaceful empire that found this world in a similar shape as we did, only with mining equipment and abandoned structures intact. After decades of mining and research, Zro use was part of their everyday life. After they found this device, and activated it, in an instant the tens of thousands of people working on the surface were instantly killed and turned into Zro. In response, this empire bombarded the planet and set up the warning beacons and defense drones.\n\nWe will continue to explore the ruins."

Known as the Osicit, they attempted to recreate and modify the process used by the Zroni to turn themselves into Zro in an attempt to protect themselves from the "Zroni Demons". In their mad desire for safety they ended up bringing slaves to be turned into Zro. This would end up being their undoing as others rose up against them, attacking this world and their Zro creation systems. Eventually forgotten to time, other empires stumbled upon this world and discovered its secrets, doomed to make the same mistakes those before them did."
