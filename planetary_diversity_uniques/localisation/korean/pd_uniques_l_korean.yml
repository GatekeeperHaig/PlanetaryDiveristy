 pdcrystal.250.name: "The Khel Ruins"
 pdcrystal.250.desc: "The jungle has overtaken much of the decaying bases and their technology, but we recovered some helpful information. The Khels, an alien species not native to this world, were conducting a planet-wide experiment involving deep boreholes into the crust.\n\nAlthough most data was corrupted, we found clues indicating a large undiscovered Khel settlement near our research post."
 pdcrystal.250.a: "Interesting."
 pdcrystal.251.desc: "At the settlement, we found the remains of a generation ship which lacked hyperspace technology. The Khels, fleeing a climate disaster on their homeworld, wandered through several systems for generations. They eventually found this planet, which seemed to meet all their needs, and began building a new home.\n\nWe will continue to shift through the Khel records."
 ancrel.251.a: "How fortunate for them."
 pdcrystal.252.desc: "The colony thrived for several years, aided by crystal pillars that enhanced their transplanted crops. But then, colonists began disappearing. At first, it seemed random, but the rate increased. In investigating the disappearances, their lead scientist made a shocking discovery: the planet was alive and feeding on them. With no way to relaunch their ship, they focused on communicating with and pacifying the planet.\n\nWe will begin to explore one of the borehole locations next."
 pdcrystal.252.a: "Is the colony at risk?"
 pdcrystal.253.desc: "The study revealed that the crystal is a lithoid superorganism with rudimentary intelligence, using the Acean to lure animals into hidden sinkholes. The Khels drilled boreholes and an electromagnetic pulse to disrupt its feeding while preserving the crystal's properties.\n\nWe have also uncovered the control center for the borehole project."
 pdcrystal.253.a: "How desperate they must have been."
 pdcrystal.254.desc: "The Khel's boreholes only hastened the planet's feeding, perhaps as a defense mechanism. By the time they were ready to fire their weapon, only a few dozen Khel remained. After the detonation, the planet released a massive surge of energy, and all records from the Khel abruptly ceased.\n\nThough the Khels didn't survive to witness it, they were correct: the planet had lost its ability to feed one life. This is the grim source of the Acean crystal's powers."
 pdcrystal.254.a: "What a grim end for everyone."
