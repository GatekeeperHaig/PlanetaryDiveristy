 ###Star Classes
 pc_d_star:0 "White Dwarf"
 pc_d_star_desc:0 "A white dwarf, is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. White dwarfs are thought to be the final evolutionary state of stars whose mass is not high enough to become a neutron star. A white dwarf is very hot when it forms, but because it has no source of energy, it will gradually radiate its energy and cool."
