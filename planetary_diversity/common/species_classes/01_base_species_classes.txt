# The Species Classes defined here are the ones you can choose from in the character creator. The portraits for prescripted races are grabbed straight from the .gfx file.
# There is also portrait_sets database that contains sets of portraits associated with species classes.
# 'graphical_culture' is connected to the looks used for ships and cities; see "common/graphical_culture/".
# playable = yes/no/trigger (default: yes)		if this species class can is playable
# randomized = yes/no/trigger (default: yes)	if this species class is randomized
# species_trait_points							base number of species trait points available for this species class
# species_max_traits							maximum number of traits that species of this class can have (doesn't count those with cost == 0)
# possible										ethics/government requirements; see common/governments/readme_requirements.txt
# gender = yes/no (default: yes)				whether the species has a gender
# portrait_modding yes/no (default: yes)		whether the portrait can be modified with e.g. genemodding or robomodding
# random_weight									increases/reduces the chance of spawning this species class
# ethics_to_prefer								list of ethics certain species class will preffer over others
# preferred_ethics_weight						increases/reduces the chance of this species class choosing one of the preferred ethics
